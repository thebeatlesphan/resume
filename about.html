		<h2>Andrews Nguyen-Phan</h2>
		<p>I am currently a Technical Analyst at Genuine Parts Company working towards the company's Automation Team. 
		I have been learning the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and coding through Java. To meet the team's needs, I have shifted my focus towards frontend development.</p>
		<p>The arts have been an important part of my life and I wish to share all the things that fascinate me. 
		I invite everyone to not only explore my mind but also share yours as well!</p>
		<p>Lastly, I would like to thank you very much for visiting my webpage and I hope you an excellent day.</p>
